## Introduction:

Statistics are a very important part of data analysis because they turn raw data into ideas that can be used.
Statistical tools can help you make smart choices whether you're summarizing data, seeing patterns, or testing theories.
This guide teaches you basic statistical ideas using R.
It focuses on t-tests, data visualization, and descriptive statistics, all while using a single dataset.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Dataset: mtcars

We will use the mtcars dataset that comes with R for this guide.
There are factors like miles per gallon (mpg), number of cylinders, horsepower, and weight for 32 different car models in this dataset.
This dataset is great for learning about basic statistical ideas and trying hypotheses.

First, let's quickly look at the dataset:

```{r}
# Load and view the mtcars dataset
data("mtcars")
head(mtcars)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting to Know the Data

It's important to understand the material we're working with before we start the analysis.
The following factors are in the mtcars dataset:

-   mpg: Miles per gallon
-   cyl: Number of cylinders
-   hp: Horsepower
-   wt: Weight (1000 lbs)
-   am: Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics give an overview of the shape, central trend, and dispersion of a dataset's distribution.
Let's figure out some important numbers that describe mpg, hp, and wt.

```{r}
# Calculate descriptive statistics
summary(mtcars[, c("mpg", "hp", "wt")])
```

As you can see, this summary shows the mean, median, minimum, maximum, and quartiles for each measure.
That is, the cars in this group get about 20.09 miles per gallon on average, with a range of 10.4 to 33.9.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Visualization

Visualizing data is an important part of figuring out how it is spread out and how different factors are related.
To look into the mtcars collection, we'll make a number of plots.

1.  Histogram of mpg A histogram shows how a single numerical value is spread out.

```{r, fig.alt="Histogram of miles per gallon (mpg)"}
# Histogram of miles per gallon (mpg)
hist(mtcars$mpg, main = "Distribution of Miles Per Gallon (mpg)", xlab = "Miles Per Gallon", col = "lightblue")
```

2.  Boxplot of mpg by Transmission You can compare distributions between groups with a boxplot. We will now compare the mpg of cars with automatic and manual engines.

```{r, fig.alt="Boxplot of mpg by transmission type"}
# Boxplot of mpg by transmission type
boxplot(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars, main = "MPG by Transmission Type", xlab = "Transmission (0 = Automatic, 1 = Manual)", ylab = "Miles Per Gallon", col = c("orange", "lightgreen"))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Comparing Means with T-Tests

You can compare the means of different groups very well with T-tests.
One-Sample, Independent Two-Sample, and Paired t-tests are the three main types of t-tests.
Let's use the mtcars dataset to look into each type.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### One-Sample T-Test

One-Sample T-Test checks if the mean of a single sample is the same as a number that is already known.
We might want to see if the mtcars dataset's average miles per gallon (mpg) is significantly different from 20 mpg.

```{r}
# One-sample t-test
t_test_one_sample <- t.test(mtcars$mpg, mu = 20)
print(t_test_one_sample)
```

The main idea (H₀) here is that the average mpg is 20.
If the p-value is less than the level of significance, which is usually 0.05, we disagree with the null hypothesis.

### Independent Two-Sample T-Test

When you use the Independent Two-Sample T-Test, you compare the means of two separate groups.
Let's look at how many miles per gallon cars with automatic (am = 0) and manual (am = 1) engines get.

```{r}
# Independent Two-Sample T-Test
t_test_independent <- t.test(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)
print(t_test_independent)
```

What does H₀ mean?
It means that there is no change in the average mpg between the two types of transmission.
There is a difference between the groups if the p-value is significant.

### Paired T-Test

The Paired T-Test looks at how the means of the same group of people changed over time.
Even though mtcars doesn't have a built-in matched structure, let's say we want to compare the mpg of two identical cars before and after a change.
We don't have this data, so let's make it up to show what we mean.

```{r}
# Simulating mpg before and after modification
set.seed(123)
mpg_before <- mtcars$mpg
mpg_after <- mpg_before + rnorm(length(mpg_before), 0, 2)  # Adding small random noise

# Paired t-test
t_test_paired <- t.test(mpg_before, mpg_after, paired = TRUE)
print(t_test_paired)
```

There is no difference in mpg before and after the change, which is the null hypothesis (H₀).
If the p-value is significant, it means that the change made a meaningful difference.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

Using the mtcars dataset, this guide has shown you how to use basic statistical ideas in R.
We began with summary statistics, made a graph of the data, and used different t-tests to compare means.
These tools give you a solid base for looking at data and coming to useful conclusions.
As you learn more advanced statistical methods, keep in mind that these basic skills will still help you a lot as you go through your data analysis experience.
