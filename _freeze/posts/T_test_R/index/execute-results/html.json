Histogram of mpg A histogram shows how a single numerical value is spread out.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Histogram of miles per gallon (mpg)\nhist(mtcars$mpg, main = \"Distribution of Miles Per Gallon (mpg)\", xlab = \"Miles Per Gallon\", col = \"lightblue\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n2.  Boxplot of mpg by Transmission You can compare distributions between groups with a boxplot. We will now compare the mpg of cars with automatic and manual engines.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Boxplot of mpg by transmission type\nboxplot(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars, main = \"MPG by Transmission Type\", xlab = \"Transmission (0 = Automatic, 1 = Manual)\", ylab = \"Miles Per Gallon\", col = c(\"orange\", \"lightgreen\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Comparing Means with T-Tests\n\nYou can compare the means of different groups very well with T-tests.\nOne-Sample, Independent Two-Sample, and Paired t-tests are the three main types of t-tests.\nLet's use the mtcars dataset to look into each type.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## One-Sample T-Test\n\nOne-Sample T-Test checks if the mean of a single sample is the same as a number that is already known.\nWe might want to see if the mtcars dataset's average miles per gallon (mpg) is significantly different from 20 mpg.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# One-sample t-test\nt_test_one_sample <- t.test(mtcars$mpg, mu = 20)\nprint(t_test_one_sample)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tOne Sample t-test\n\ndata:  mtcars$mpg\nt = 0.08506, df = 31, p-value = 0.9328\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 20\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 17.91768 22.26357\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n 20.09062 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe main idea (H₀) here is that the average mpg is 20.\nIf the p-value is less than the level of significance, which is usually 0.05, we disagree with the null hypothesis.\n\n## Independent Two-Sample T-Test\n\nWhen you use the Independent Two-Sample T-Test, you compare the means of two separate groups.\nLet's look at how many miles per gallon cars with automatic (am = 0) and manual (am = 1) engines get.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Independent Two-Sample T-Test\nt_test_independent <- t.test(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)\nprint(t_test_independent)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tWelch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  mpg by am\nt = -3.7671, df = 18.332, p-value = 0.001374\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 0 and group 1 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -11.280194  -3.209684\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 0 mean in group 1 \n       17.14737        24.39231 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat does H₀ mean?\nIt means that there is no change in the average mpg between the two types of transmission.\nThere is a difference between the groups if the p-value is significant.\n\n## Paired T-Test\n\nThe Paired T-Test looks at how the means of the same group of people changed over time.\nEven though mtcars doesn't have a built-in matched structure, let's say we want to compare the mpg of two identical cars before and after a change.\nWe don't have this data, so let's make it up to show what we mean.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Simulating mpg before and after modification\nset.seed(123)\nmpg_before <- mtcars$mpg\nmpg_after <- mpg_before + rnorm(length(mpg_before), 0, 2)  # Adding small random noise\n\n# Paired t-test\nt_test_paired <- t.test(mpg_before, mpg_after, paired = TRUE)\nprint(t_test_paired)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tPaired t-test\n\ndata:  mpg_before and mpg_after\nt = 0.23758, df = 31, p-value = 0.8138\nalternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.6075656  0.7677806\nsample estimates:\nmean difference \n      0.0801075 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere is no difference in mpg before and after the change, which is the null hypothesis (H₀).\nIf the p-value is significant, it means that the change made a meaningful difference.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Conclusion\n\nUsing the mtcars dataset, this guide has shown you how to use basic statistical ideas in R.\nWe began with summary statistics, made a graph of the data, and used different t-tests to compare means.\nThese tools give you a solid base for looking at data and coming to useful conclusions.\nAs you learn more advanced statistical methods, keep in mind that these basic skills will still help you a lot as you go through your data analysis experience.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Resources & References:\n\n1.  **\"R for Data Science\"** by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham\n\n    The book is available for free online.\n    [Link to the book](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)\n\n2.  **\"An Introduction to Statistical Learning\"** by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani\n\n3.  **\"R Documentation -
